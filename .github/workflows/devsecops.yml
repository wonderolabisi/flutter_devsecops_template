          ## 💡 Recommendations
          
          ### Immediate Actions
          1. **Review Critical Findings:** Address any critical or high-severity issues immediately
          2. **Update Dependencies:** Keep all dependencies up to date using Dependabot
          3. **Secret Management:** Use GitHub Secrets or environment variables for sensitive data
          
          ### Continuous Improvement
          1. **Regular Scans:** This pipeline runs on every push and PR
          2. **Security Training:** Keep development team updated on secure coding practices
          3. **Monitoring:** Review security reports regularly
          
          ### Tools Configuration
          - **TruffleHog:** Configured for verified secrets only (entropy 4.5+)
          - **Dart Analyzer:** Enhanced security analysis enabled
          - **Dependency Scanning:** Weekly automated updates via Dependabot
