## 🛡️ Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog scans for accidentally committed secrets
- **SAST**: CodeQL performs static application security testing
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in dependencies
- **Container Security**: Trivy scans for container vulnerabilities

### Continuous Monitoring
- Security scans run on every push and pull request
- Weekly scheduled security audits
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security advisories monitoring

### Severity Levels
Our security scanning focuses on:
- **Critical**: Immediate action required
- **High**: Address within 7 days
- **Medium**: Address within 30 days
- **Low**: Address in next release cycle
